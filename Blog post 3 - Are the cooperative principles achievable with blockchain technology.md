TODO:
* Rework the below article to look at the 7 cooperative principles, and then comment on how they can be achieved with dApps.
* Should be able to integrate the stuff I already have below into this new framework.
* Aim to keep it relatively concise

#### 2) Prioritize user experience and low barrier-to-entry

One of the biggest downsides of blockchain technology is that it has a high barrier to entry, requiring in-depth technical knowledge about computer security and various new tools. For a platform cooperative that aims to bring about economic justice, the product dApp itself should prioritize user experience (UX). The "play to earn" apps cited before, like [StepN](https://stepn.com/), offer a good model for this. They can be downloaded and installed via App Stores like normal mobile phone apps, and the user doesn't even need to know they are interacting with a blockchain. Best practice security like two-factor authentication is the default, so user's wallets are protected. Furthermore, the apps include tutorials about how to save your recovery phrase and that you should *never* share it with anyone, which is in line with the [5th cooperative principle](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity) of education.

An area where StepN app does not prioritize usability is adding funds or payment methods to the app. They instead direct people to centralized exchanges like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), asking the users to buy Solana or similar cryptocurrencies on their own. The [Eva](https://eva.coop/) driver coop app has a better way to handle this, operating with the EOS blockchain but still [accepting regular credit card based payments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlKbF1hhEFA). 

#### 3) Scaling federation

As described above, a traditional cooperative attempting to federate runs into practical challenges around how to share infrastructure or funds and also how to operate legally across national or state borders.

If the app was built as a dApp on an application-specific blockchain fully owned and operated by the cooperative itself, as made possible with Cosmos SDK, then the sharing of infrastructure would be relatively easy. The smart contracts underlying the app and its governance would be open source, viewable from the block explorer and callable by any new member. Additionally, the chain would be interoperable with [countless adjacent blockchains](https://mapofzones.com/) offering their own infrastructure. For example, any Cosmos chain can tap into the [Axelar network](https://axelar.network/) to access stable coins pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, which would facilitate the UX of accepting normal credit card payments.

Each member of the federation would be able to customize the dApps to their liking, including building their own apps that interoperate with the existing ones. This would allow a type of "vertical integration" that we have already seen with platform capitalism, e.g. as Uber expanded into food delivery. A food delivery dApp could be deployed to the same Cosmos-based blockchain, use the same dual token model for governance and fundraising (or introduce a separate token to fundraise that specific new expansion), and take advantage of any reputation or identity systems already built up.

The distributed consensus needed to achieve the trust-less guarantees of blockchain is already ready for planet-scale from a technical perspective. Billions of dollars are already [secured using the same tools](https://tendermint.com/security/), so as the platform coop scaled up in terms of revenue, they wouldn't have to worry. If they did start with a home-grown validator set (possibly using Raspberry Pis as suggested above), they could choose to adopt [inter-chain security](https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035) as they scaled.

Tackling the legal challenges of operating across national borders would still be a big challenge, but no more difficult than without a blockchain. Similar to the dual token model, a dual corporation model can be used which pairs a legal cooperative entity with a DAO entity. [This post](https://umamifinance.medium.com/introducing-umami-dao-foundation-umami-labs-llc-a3f92f137198) describes an LLC + DAO rather than a legal cooperative + DAO, but explains the motivation well. Overall, the goal is to have a real legal entity that can help with interacting with legacy institutions like governments and traditional banks, while allowing the DAO to handle all the digital- and blockchain-native components.

#### 4) Lean into off-chain benefits

One critique to the approach of a mobile app that "hides" the blockchain (as described above under UX), is that it loses out on transparency. Hiding the blockchain often requires supplementing it with some off-chain client-server interactions. When every interaction is not verified on the blockchain itself, people may rightly wonder what is happening under the hood. This can be partially mitigated by open sourcing all the client and server code, using signatures to prove that such code is what is packaged, and inviting regular audits of the backend. But this is one area where a platform cooperative can choose to fall back on the high-trust relationships of their local community, e.g. by having a collective committee of multiple people responsible for the checks and balances of managing these off-chain components. In other words, not everything has to be on-chain if off-chain trust can be established.

Platform coops that operate with real world actions like ride sharing also have additional benefits. Using a person's phone GPS is a relatively trustworthy way to establish the number of miles traveled, even if it is off-chain. Additionally, the real-world interactions are a lot harder to abuse for the purposes of "farming tokens" - a practice where malicious actors may try to get more tokens by performing actions across many distinct blockchain identities. This practice is particularly likely when using quadratic voting, as was proposed above, since there is incentive to spread one's tokens across different wallets to maximum voting power. However, one benefit of requiring real world GPS tracking is that it's a lot harder to farm 100 ride-share trips than it is to issue a script to farm 100 DeFi trades (as people are doing to farm [possible airdrops](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1584518035142217730)).

Lastly, it's worth noting that much of the blockchain-based projects out there are operating on increasingly abstract financial concepts like perpetuals and binary options. It may be a breath of fresh air for investors to see a platform cooperative offering a token that accrues value based on real-world economic activity.

### Summary: Does this approach deliver on the cooperative principles?

In closing, let's revisit the proposed blueprint considering the [7 cooperative principles](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity):

* **Voluntary and open membership.** The dApp would be usable by anyone that downloads it from the app store. Governance power (and thus membership) would accrue to any member that uses the platform properly. No racial, gender, or other markers would affect this, and quadratic voting should ensure equitable power even across economic classes.
  
* **Democratic member control.** Governance would happen on decentralized voting platforms utilizing the governance token. There is a wide spectrum of voting tools and mechanisms depending on the exact goals, but one-token-one-vote with quadratic weighting could approximate one-member-one-vote ideals. If precisely one-member-one-vote mechanics were desired, one simple approach would be to leverage off-chain identity. For example, the [Ethereum Name Service](https://docs.ens.domains/) allows linking Twitter handles to an Ethereum domain (it requires someone to post a tweet with a random message, and then use their private key to sign a message with that same random message). Alternatively, an on-chain tool like [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) can be used.
  
* **Member economic participation.** All income into the platform would be held on the blockchain, controlled by the DAO governance which only members would have access to. Members would vote on exactly how that income is distributed back to the dual token holders. The use of blockchain based value accounting would allow automated, unbiased, and transparent distribution to members.
  
* **Autonomy and independence.** The use of the dual token model will ensure that financial speculators do not gain any governance rights over the cooperative, but only receive profit-sharing that may have a limited lifetime or ceiling. 
  
* **Education and training.** The app will include tutorials on best practices around private key security. The platform cooperative will also document in open source all its governance processes so everyone can understand it and learn from it.
  
* **Cooperation among cooperatives.** The use of a Cosmos-based blockchain comes with the built-in ability for [interoperability](https://ibcprotocol.org/). The future experimental use of SBTs would be shared with other like-minded cooperatives so they all gain the benefits. By open sourcing any novel smart contracts, e.g. the dual token model and any particularities around minting and voting mechanisms, this would be fostering public goods for all cooperatives to benefit from. Direct mutual aid to other cooperatives could also be built into the treasury management, voted on by members.
  
* **Concern for community.** Being a multi-stakeholder cooperative with real users from the community as voting members, the community needs can be democratically represented. Furthermore, the federation process of expanding to new geographic locations should include requirements about education and giving back to those locales. One direct financial example is that the treasury could choose to contribute 10% of profits to the local cities where they operate.

I hope this article was useful to aid in the imagination of scaling platform cooperatives. Blockchain technology is not a perfect solution and is not expected to be desirable for all cooperatives, but for those cooperatives that need novel ways to fundraise while also building digitally native communities, blockchain technology can help scale the trust and mission beyond local spaces.
