### A blueprint for federating a platform cooperative with blockchain technology

For this blueprint, let's imagine a prospective platform coop that intends to build a ride-sharing platform like Uber. This is already a crowded space in the platform coop world (e.g. [Eva](https://eva.coop/) and [The Drivers Coop](https://drivers.coop/)), but was chosen because at this point the product is familiar. Let's assume the coop started with a hyper-local focus, building an app that only serves a small city. This was incorporated as a formal multi-stakeholder cooperative, with workers, drivers, and riders each earning the right to become members and vote to inform the product direction. As of now, the coop only uses traditional technology like Amazon Web Services and SQL databases, without any blockchain components. As they seek to scale via federation, how can blockchain technology help?

#### 1) Fundraising with a dual-token model

As [case studies have shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352641478_Challenges_and_Success_Potentials_of_Platform_Cooperatives_Insights_from_a_Multiple_Case_Study) have shown, lack of funding is one of the top challenges facing platform coops. Building or buying the non-trivial app technology for ridesharing is very costly, and traditional venture funding or bank loans are difficult for cooperative companies to acquire.

In contrast, the overall blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem is ripe with capital, even in the 2022 bear market. One extreme example of this is how the "meme coin" Dogecoin market cap recently received an influx of $12 billion, primarily from speculators that think Elon Musk's reorganization of Twitter could include a Doge based payment mechanism. For platform coops that might only need a few hundred thousand dollars to build the initial version of their apps, this type of money is astounding.

One mechanism to raise money in the blockchain space is to issue a token representing your project. Theoretically, issuing a token is analogous to equity in the stock market, allowing a company to raise money now in return for the future value they may create. This was a playbook followed blindly in the [2017 ICO (initial coin offering) craze](https://hackernoon.com/3-moments-in-history-that-explain-the-ico-bubble-e7c42896ca6f), without any concrete connection between the token and the product (if there even was a product). Nowadays there is a bit more scrutiny. Projects tend to launch tokens along with an explanation of the tokenomics: how many tokens are given to whom, what is their vesting schedule, and how are they created or destroyed. Projects often publish a detailed roadmap that they can be held accountable to. Still, those that attract a lot of capital tend to use less than sustainable means, such as distributing a growing supply of tokens to incentivize users (not unlike the strategy that venture capital firms used to [subsidize ride sharing costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/technology/farewell-millennial-lifestyle-subsidy.html) and attract early Uber riders). It is only recently in the 2022 bear market that speculators have paid more attention to ["real yield"](https://sabocrypto.substack.com/p/the-harsh-reality-of-real-yield), seeking out tokens that directly distribute their product revenue to token holders and also where the token supply itself does not inflate beyond its revenue.

Issuing tokens comes with a lot of downsides, however. Most obviously is the connection to degenerate speculation, which can cause the prices of tokens to vary wildly. A project may raise a sizable sum that evaporates overnight. The other serious problem comes when the token is used for governance, since the common one-token-one-vote model becomes a de-facto plutocracy. 

This reminds me of a problem that multi-stakeholder cooperatives already face outside of the blockchain world: how to align the interests of supporters and member-owners. A [survey of shared-services platform cooperatives](https://platform.coop/blog/2020-research-reports-by-the-fellows-of-the-institute-for-the-cooperative-digital-economy/) ([PDF](https://ia801707.us.archive.org/9/items/morshed-mannan-single-web/Morshed%20Mannan_single_web.pdf)) published by the Institute for Cooperative Digital Economy includes a case study about [The Mobility Factory (TMF)](https://themobilityfactory.coop/) which offers a possible solution in the form of a dual class share system. TMF has Class A shares for user-members, while Class B shares are for supporter-members. The different classes come with different governance rules, with the general idea being to create a balance between user interests (e.g. lower prices and higher wages) with supporter interests (e.g. sustainable revenue). This concept can be combined with the idea of [revenue-based financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue-based_financing) cited in Austin Robey's [How to Start a Cooperative](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-start-a-cooperative/), to ensure that the Class of shares used for fundraising does not conflict with the Class of shares used for governance.

The above idea gives rise to a proposal for a **[dual token model](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-the-dual-token-model)**. Such a model could be implemented on any smart contract platform but would receive additional flexibility and cost-savings if using a blockchain like Cosmos that offers dApps maximum sovereignty in their token design. 

One token is used for fundraising, and can follow usual tokenomics, e.g. allocations for team/DAO, marketing and incentives, airdropping to users, and made available on the open market using an [IDO](https://cointelegraph.com/funding-for-beginners/initial-dex-offering-ido). There are various decentralized tools to ensure fairness and wide distribution (think crowd funding rather than venture funding) during an initial token bootstrapping, such time-weighted [liquidity bootstrapping pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps). Importantly, this fundraising token will NOT have any governance rights, allowing the cooperative to retain its ownership and follow the coop principle of autonomy & independence. What the fundraising token should have is a smart contract enforced method of distributing platform profits to holders (e.g. 50% of profits); this "real yield" as described above is what many cryptocurrency investors are expecting these days. It would be up to the project whether this profit-sharing would continue ad infinitum, or whether it will follow the [revenue-based financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue-based_financing) model of terminating after some fixed return on investment. With smart contracts, it would be easy to implement a token that burns (read: destroys) itself after it has accrued certain revenue. This burning mechanism might even produce a flywheel effect for speculators that are attracted to deflationary monetary policy, while ensuring that the platform's revenue doesn't fully leak to speculators.

The second token would be used for governance. The token would not be available on the open market and would only be minted with use of the platform itself. The goal of this would be to accrue governance power to actual users of the platform, in line with the platform cooperative principles. In this way, it would follow the model set up by "play to earn" games like [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) or [StepN](https://stepn.com/), where various in-app and/or real world interactions produce tokens. In a ride-sharing app, you could imagine that this token might accrue based on the number of miles ridden and driven (with weighting set up so that drivers and riders receive an appropriate split). StepN is a good example to follow because it leverages mobile phone GPS to track the amount of distance you walk or run, and also uses this GPS mechanism to prevent cheating. Unlike such apps, these tokens would not be tradeable and so there would be no need to solve for the [economic sustainability problems](https://mirror.xyz/0x63Cd1F33294ecA378BaEbBa8ee22F3ac6723aDd4/VHpfoT4uDkLJZ-zADZCnwExnwOXZ7PCAITQuwTw_kDo) that these tokens face.

One experimental approach to non-tradeable tokens is further explored in a [recent whitepaper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) co-authored by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. This paper introduces the concept of "Soulbound tokens" (SBTs). Many of the implications covered in that paper are outside the scope of this blog post, but the relevant concept is that reputation could accrue to a specific digital identity in a way that cannot be traded. For a cooperative, this form of reputation tracking would ensure that actual users of the platform are receiving voting rights commensurate to the value they produce. This technology also aligns with the 6th [cooperative principle](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity) about cooperatives supporting other cooperatives, since the adoption of SBTs by cooperatives will help all other cooperatives with things like bootstrapping [Sybil resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) and facilitating [composability](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/) . If implemented properly, SBT-based reputation would also allow for transparency and portability that platform cooperatives strive for, e.g. allowing drivers to see how and why they earned certain reputation, and to be able to bring that reputation to a different platform if desired.

As the [DisCO principles warn](https://stacco.works/2021/10/05/disco-in-7-principles-and-11-values/), reputation value accrual should not be strictly determined by what profits the platform, but should be based on real needs, accounting for social and environmental impacts. In our ride-sharing example, those users with more financial means would be more able to take more rides. If we took a naive approach for this governance token minting, then such users could effectively buy votes even without the token being traded on the open market. This could be solved for with more complex minting logic, or could be solved in the voting mechanism, e.g. by using [quadratic voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEHv-dE4xl8). As described in the soulbound paper, quadratic voting can be combined with SBTs to further prevent abuse, e.g. by discounting the vote weight for any like votes where the souls voting hold similar SBTs. In this way, the governance system would give more weight to more diverse individuals. That said, these uses of SBTs is experimental and uncharted territory, and so in the interest of short-term practicality, a much simpler approach could be taken -- keeping the governance tokens sealed in a smart contract that does not implement transfer functions.

It is also worth noting that the use of a dual token model where the fundraising token is strictly separated from the utility (governance) token can also help [avoid certain legal headaches](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/insight-the-dual-nature-of-utility-tokens-and-dual-token-structures), making it less likely that the token is considered a "security" by the SEC and regulated as such. This is also a reminder that fundraising approaches like this are an extremely uncertain legal landscape and may not be safe in all jurisdictions.
