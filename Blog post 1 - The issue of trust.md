- Revise the ethereum section by bringing up the paradox of blockchain trust. While consensus is trust less, you have to trust the L1 ecosystem that you build on.
	- EIP process offers an interesting caution. EIPs can be proposed by anyone in the community, but they require consensus across the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This process is stewarded by "Ethereum Cat Herders", a name that points to the difficulty of finding consensus across such a diverse group of people. This is the key challenge of a "world computer", and something that historical empires have shown us leads to centralized representational governance.

### The issue of trust

Blockchains are a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that are built to be trust-less. These systems assume actors could be malicious or unreliable (aka [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)), and so they use cryptographic proofs in combination with distributed algorithms to allow safely reaching global consensus even in the midst of 50% malicious actors (see: [51% attack](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp)). The [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in 2008 introduced the novel [Nakomoto longest chain wins protocol](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-10-15-Nakamoto-Consensus/) to solve this problem, while other approaches like [Tendermint](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/9769) put a modern spin on classical research from the 1980s and 1990s. These systems layer on [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) or [Proof of Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) to make it economically infeasible for malicious entities to pull off attacks, and the decade-plus history of Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest these approaches are resilient (see: [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)).

Regardless of the algorithm used, one thing is certain: there is a high cost to this zero-trust assumption. It costs an average of $0.95 per transaction to send Bitcoin in 2022, while the [average gas fee](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3y) to interact with an Ethereum smart contract fluctuates wildly between $1 and over $100. Since these systems solve the zero-trust problem with economic incentives, and their distributed algorithms have limited scalability in the form of ["block space"](https://www.generalist.com/briefing/blockspace), the cost to transact becomes a highest-bidder-wins scenario. Imagine an 8-lane toll booth with growing queues, where the richest drivers willingly pay $100 to skip the wait. This quickly devolves into a plutocracy, and becomes most cost prohibitive during [times of crisis](https://decrypt.co/100262/ethereum-gas-prices-soar-traders-head-stablecoin-exits).

Contrast this to the [historic operation of cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Society_of_Equitable_Pioneers), which often sprung up precisely to bring economic justice in the midst of a crisis. Coops, when founded in local communities, tend to be high-trust institutions. Each member-owner is likely to know each other personally due to the geographically localized nature of operation, and due to the fact that many coops begin as collective reading groups. This is even more true in coops rooted in feminist principles (see [DisCO Manifesto](https://disco.coop/manifesto/)) where caring for individual members is a key part of meetings and other dynamics.

A nascent platform cooperative will most likely start locally and therefore have the benefit of this high-trust atmosphere. This begs the question: is the high cost of trust-less blockchain technology worthwhile for coops that already have high trust among members? At best, it seems inefficient for coops to pay a high premium for trust-less guarantees which they don't need. At worst, the high gas fees of some blockchain platforms can stop a coop with minimal funds from getting off the ground: during a high-traffic time, setting up a [multi-signature wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/) , registering an [ENS domain](https://ens.domains/), and deploying a new smart contract could easily cost hundreds of dollars in gas fees.

The transaction cost issues can be partially mitigated by leveraging Layer 2 blockchains like [Arbitrum](https://developer.arbitrum.io/intro), or blockchains with low transaction fees such as [Solana](https://docs.solana.com/introduction). However, this ignores the even larger cost of technical expertise required to get involved with this complex technology. The basic philosophical question remains: does it really make sense for a high-trust local coop to use technology that is built to work with zero trust? Are there any benefits that come from this trustlessness? And are there any ways to take advantage of the high trust that a coop might have locally?

The one thing that trustless blockchains offer for coops is scalability. While it may be true that a platform coop starts locally and expands to a few dozen member-owners that all know and trust each other, the platform may aspire to grow larger. This is not growth for growth's sake, but can also be part of the cooperative's mission to contribute to global public goods infrastructure or being able to offer [high-paying](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/raising-the-floor-of-the-platform-economy-co-ops-unions-and-the-struggle-to-transform-technology/), [stable](https://www.shareable.net/why-taxi-cooperatives-offer-better-job-security-for-drivers/), [high-dignity jobs](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/09/worker-co-ops-photos-labor-democracy-communitarian-no-boss/) to more people. Certain platform products (especially any two-sided marketplace) will require sufficient scale to deliver on their product goals via network effects. As this growth happens, the ability to form personal relations (and thus trust) diminishes. [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) suggests that people are limited to ~150 relationships. A traditional approach to scale coops is to form a federation of independent local entities, but this runs into practical challenges around how to share infrastructure or funds and also how to operate legally across national or state borders. Trustless blockchain technology can help here, which we will explore in the subsequent articles of this blog series.

A final point on the philosophical underpinnings of cooperative trust is that some blockchains may be more compatible than others. The Ethereum model can be crudely summarized as trying to make a "world computer", but a competing vision in the [Cosmos ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/) is instead trying to enable the creation of many ["community computers"](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1466092508316905478). Founders of Cosmos like Ethan Buchman and Zaki Manian have explained the differing vision [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO5OO5vOlys) [various](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbomgw-PGRE) [podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80wQ-lT92nw). Buchman points out how Ethereum's model focuses on rock-solid centralized security, but this comes at the loss of sovereignty in each application and the cost of gas (which we might term "rent" in this context) - analogous to various empires of history who offered military protection and shared infrastructure in return for taxes and cultural assimilation. The [Cosmos thesis](https://research.paradigm.xyz/cosmos-thesis) is instead about creating the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) that leverages open-source [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) consensus protocol and [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/) (inter-blockchain communication) to form a toolkit for creating one's own blockchain. Much of this work is pushed forward by organizations that are themselves [coops](https://informal.systems/2020/09/21/informal-owners/), [foundations](https://interchain.io/about), and  [DAOs](https://mirror.xyz/infinet.eth/pI3GsxxU28eYlLi-4noRIX6UdcxcpUfiG7IK0m5-dqg).

Using Cosmos, a platform coop could create not only their own dApp but also their own blockchain, freeing them from the extractive gas models of blockchains like Ethereum or the [dubious](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/09/how-will-the-binance-ftx-drama-affect-solana-heres-what-we-know-so-far/) [VC connections](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/solana/) of low-cost blockchains like Solana that make users wonder if they are the product. The benefits ultimately go far beyond gas costs, though. A platform cooperative building their own blockchain could form the foundational layer in which federated coops could deploy and manage their applications. The common issues which face all global platform coops, like how to raise funds, vote on decisions, and distribute earnings could be solved at this blockchain level, drastically reducing the development time and cost for each additional dApp. Obviously this is a huge undertaking, but seems like a better idea than each blockchain-interested platform coop building their own smart contracts that depend on a huge financial ecosystem like Ethereum which they will have no material control over.

Zooming out from the aspirational platform coop foundational blockchain, Cosmos can also offer small-scale coops an interesting option if they desire to run their own blockchain. In a high-trust local coop, one idea would be for each member-owner or committee group within the coop to run a validator node. There are non-zero costs associated with running such servers, but if the volume of the blockchain is relatively low, it could easily run on a [low-cost, low-power computer](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/running-in-production.html#hardware) such as a $35 [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). There are also technical barriers to running validators, but for a platform cooperative that is already investing in technology and software, there should hopefully be some expertise available to help with this setup.

In summary, platform coops in their early, geographically local stages are likely to have much higher trust than that which is assumed by blockchain technology. This means they will be paying a wasteful premium for zero-trust assumptions they don't immediately need. For many coops, there really is no need to get involved with blockchains at all. However, for platform coop that expect to scale or seek to raise capital from diverse sources, the benefits of trustless blockchains can increase their ability to grow while maintaining their principles. The "community computer" vision of Cosmos seems a particularly good fit for platform coops and should be explored further.
